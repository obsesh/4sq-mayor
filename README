Use this script to become the mayor of virtually any foursquare venue. By generating an oauth token, and picking a venue from the 4sq database, this script creates a automated job (read: cronjob) that runs every day and checks you in to the venue you selected. After a while, the current mayor will have no choice but to forfeit his crown over to you.

Mwahahahaha. Our sinister plan will succedd.

How to run:
<pre>
bundle install
ruby mayor.rb
